Project Name: COVID Management System
Programming Language: C

By Md. Shakhawat Hossain

INTRODUCTION:

The COVID Management System is an application developed using the C programming language. It is designed to facilitate the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine to the general public and to store their information for future reference.

OBJECTIVES:

The project consists of three main sections:
1. Covid-19 Vaccine Registration
2. Registration Status Checking
3. Administrator Access

The "Covid-19 Vaccine Registration" section allows individuals to register for the COVID-19 vaccine by providing their information such as Name, Age, NID, or Birth Certificate. This information will be stored for further processing. The "Registration Status Checking" section enables individuals to view their registration status, and make modifications if necessary. The "Administrator Access" section allows administrators to view all information and update vaccine names and dose programs for individuals.

FEATURES:

User/Admin login is required to access the program.
View Information: Users/Admin can view stored data.
Registration: Users can register for the program, and the system will provide them with an ID number and a username for login.
Edit Information: Users can edit their information, and administrators can also make changes.
Add Information about Individuals: Administrators can input vaccine names and required doses.
Return or Jump: Users can exit the program or navigate to other options.

After using the program, the user must log out before another user can log in.
